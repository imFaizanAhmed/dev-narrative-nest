## Overview
  <p>
    Dev narrative is a web application where your projects come to life through captivating storytelling.
  </p>
  
## Motivation
  <p>
    I, as full stack developer, wanted to improve my development skills by adding more stacks to my portfolio. So I decided to build a app using <strong>NestJs</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong>. All of these, I haven't used before and wanted to know.
  </p>
  <p>
  For a little bit research (using chatGPT), I selected this app.
